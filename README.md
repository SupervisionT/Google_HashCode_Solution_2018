Hello eveyone!
In this repo I'll talk about my experiance in [Google HashCode challenge](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/), how to think in the problems and how to solve the Pizza problem and the schaduling problem as well.

[Hash Code](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/) is a programming competition organized by Google in Europe, Middle-East and Africa. The problems are real engineering problem from Google and that what make it spaceil so you may learn more how to recrute your skills in math, programming, data structure and more to solve a real problem.

You may check the [**past editions**](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/past_editions.html) to learn more about what real problem Google has.

The challeng has three rounds:
  1. __Practice Round.__
  2. __Online Qualification Round.__
  3. __Final Round.__

### What Google expect from you ?
Google is not looking after your code!. They are looking for the way you analyze the problem, how you are going to build your algorithm and what data structure techniques that you are going to use.

They are expecting two types of solutions, classic and modern.
* The classic solution should work fine in a small dataset but not for big one. Also don't expect the get out with the optimum solution. 
* The modern solution focus on the performance and to reduce the complexity so it'll work fast for any dataset size. Also it works to optimize the solution and to minimize the error.

In this repo we'll talk about the first and second rounds. The third round will be held in *Dublin* for the top scoring teams.
We'll show a classic solution and a modern solution for each round.

## __Practice Round.__
